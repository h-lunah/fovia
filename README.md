# Fovia
This is a fully standalone Linux distribution made to boot from an ED (Extended Density) floppy disk.

## How?
I have found out the strats and ways to slim down BusyBox and the Linux kernel, then pack everything with XZ into a floppy disk. It can allow 64-bit distributions to fit in one disk.

<sub><sup>The strats are defined [here](http://ptspts.blogspot.com/2013/12/how-to-make-smaller-c-and-c-binaries.html?m=1).</sub></sup>

## Why?
It is a fun project, but doesn't serve much purpose, as feature support is extremely limited.

<sub><sup>Even [NanoArch](https://github.com/piotr25691/nanoarch) is more functional at this point.</sub></sup>

## Name?
The project name is derived from the Greek word "φοβία" (fovía), which is a member of the same family of projects started under https://i.lunah.online, the Phobic image host.

## Logo?
I'm still branding this, you'll see this later.
