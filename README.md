# Fovia
This is a fully standalone bootstrapper for Alpine Linux, smaller than Tiny Core Linux.

## How?
I have found out the strats and ways to slim down BusyBox, Linux kernel and Alpine, then pack everything with XZ into a CD. It can allow a 64-bit distribution to fit in a very small space.

<sub><sup>The strats are defined [here](http://ptspts.blogspot.com/2013/12/how-to-make-smaller-c-and-c-binaries.html?m=1).</sub></sup>

## Why?
It is a fun project, and now it is actually usable!

## Name?
The base project name is derived from the Greek word "φοβία" (fovía), which is a member of the same family of projects started under https://i.lunah.online, the Phobic image host.

## Logo?
I'm still branding this, you'll see this later, maybe.
